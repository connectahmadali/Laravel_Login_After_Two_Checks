Laravel Login System with Security Checks
This project demonstrates a robust login system built with Laravel, incorporating two essential security checks: authentication verification and network information verification. The system is designed to ensure secure access to your application by validating user credentials and network information before granting access.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

PHP 7.3 or higher
Composer
Node.js and npm
MySQL Server
Database Configuration
Before running the project, configure your database connection in the .env file located at the root of your project directory. Update the following variables with your MySQL database details:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=YOUR_DB_NAME
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

Replace YOUR_DB_NAME with the name of your database. If your MySQL server uses a different username or password, update DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD accordingly.

Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following commands to install PHP and Node.js dependencies:

composer install
npm install

Run Migrations: Execute the database migrations to create the necessary tables:
php artisan migrate
Compile Assets: Compile your assets using Laravel Mix:
npm run dev
Start the Server: Finally, start the Laravel development server:
php artisan serve
This command will start the server, and you can access your application by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your web browser.

Security Checks
The login system includes two security checks:

Authentication Verification: Ensures that the user is authenticated before granting access.
Network Information Verification: Validates network information to prevent unauthorized access from unrecognized networks.
These checks are implemented to enhance the security of your application, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system.

This revised README provides a clear and professional overview of your Laravel Login System project, including prerequisites, installation steps, and a brief description of the security checks implemented.
